    "Below, we define start and end dates to get ticker data in order to create our portfolio. We defined it from 2020-11-26 to 2021-11-26, or a 1 year interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we chose to base our portfolio off of 1 year of historical data is because we wanted a timeframe that wasn't too long that our short-term risky portfolio would capture \"too much\" irrelevant data - for example, we chose to use standard deviation as a factor in creating our portfolio and using too long of a timeframe might cause our code to choose a stock that used to be volatile, but is now \"safe\". We also didn't want to use too short of a time interval since our portfolio uses correlation to choose stocks that tend to trade in the same direction - using too short of a timeframe would capture stocks that may be correlated for a short interval by pure coincidence or by broader-market forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the perfect interval we found after backtesting our code many times on different timeframes and lists of tickers happened to be 1 year. 1 year perfectly captures the stocks with the most momentum to make our portfolio risky, but also ensures that the stocks in our portfolio are correlated for a reason, rather than by pure coincidence or market forces.\n",

    "Next, we reformatted the data such that it contains ticker history closing prices for the 1 year interval. For this data, we kept it as daily data rather than resampling it to monthly or weekly data.\n",

    "The reason why we chose to use daily data to calculate the metrics for our portfolio (such as STD and Correlation) is because we found that it produced the best results when backtesting our short-term risky portfolio. We decided against using monthly closing prices for our portfolio since using 1 year of historical data would only give us 12 closing prices to decide our portfolio off of - which is too little. We also tried using weekly data and decided against it since we found that it didn't capture the most short-term volatile stocks. Weekly data tended to give us stocks that were volatile by coincidence (such as news causing a sharp drop or rise in stock price), rather stocks that are intrinsically volatile (like oil stocks, which are volatile not by coincidence but because oil is a volatile asset). Thus, we found that daily data gave us the most intrinsically short-term volatile stocks to build our risky portfolio."

To overcome this, we make sure that the STD of the basket of stocks WITH the highest correlation is higher than the STD of the basket of stocks that are strongly negatively correlated against the stock with the highest STD. In the case that this is false, then our portfolio becomes the stocks with the strongly negatively correlated stocks.

    "## How we came up with our list of tickers\n",
    "When thinking about what a risky portfolio is, we directed our focus to creating the least diverse portfolio made with the most volatile stocks. Instantly, we wanted to create a portfolio with 10 volatile stocks with high stds over a reasonable time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original thought process was to compare industries and find the industry with stocks which have the highest std. This would create very little diversification as stocks in the same industry tend to trend the same way. However, this method was ineffective for numerous reasons. The code would be far less efficient as we must call the info dictionary to get the industry and track down how many industries there are, moreover, we must check if there are even 10 stocks in each industry. Furthermore, one overtly volatile stock in one industry would lead us to base the portfolio on that industry; this is a problem as the industry might be relatively safe other than that one volatile stock creating a safe portfolio consequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we shifted our approach to look at correlation of each stock to the stock with the highest std. This would grant us to create two groups of stocks; stocks that positively correlate with the stock with the highest std and stocks that negatively correlate. The two lists of stocks were then reorganized by highest to lowest std and the top 10 were picked from each list. This method grants us to create two lists of stocks which are very risky and have a history of correlating with each other (less diversification within each list). We then take the list of stocks which have the higher average std. If the group of stocks with the higher average std has less than 10 stocks, we just take stocks from the bottom of the list of the original organized list of oppositely correlating stocks. In other words, from the list of tickers, we have limited it down to 10 stocks which all relatively correlate in the same direction and are very volatile. Correlation is better than industry as industries also correlate with each other so by being inclusive of multiple industries through correlation, we get access to other volatile stocks in other industries.\n"

    "## 35% diversification method:\n",
    "In the final part of the program, we’ve implemented a diversification method to determine the proportion of stocks bought using the 100,000, which we called the 35% diversification method. Our goal for the group is to create the most risky portfolio possible. As stated above, our condition for a risky portfolio is to have the least amount of variation of stocks possible, a low volume for each stock, and a high standard deviation for each stock, more importantly, the stocks in the portfolio have to correlate in the same direction.\n",
    "However, in the rules for the competition, we are required to have a minimum of 10 stocks, and no value of a specific stock in the portfolio should weigh over 35%. Therefore, according to our condition for a high risk portfolio, we decided to make a portfolio with only 10 stocks. Another rule for the assignment is that each stock must make up a minimum of (100/(2n))% of the portfolio therefore, this leaves us with a portfolio of 10 stocks, and no stocks could be weighted higher than 35% or lower than 5%.\n",
    "At the point of the code before implementing the 35% diversification method, we’ve already got a list of 10 stocks that are given in a decreasing order of standard deviation(calculated by previous historic data), and also correlated in the same direction, that means the first stock in the list is the most volatile, where as the last stock is the most volatile, but among the ten stocks. Since we know the list is given in a decreasing order, we wish to allocate our proportion of investment in a decreasing order as well, meaning that we put the most money in the first stock in the list and the least in the last stock, which optimizes the risk. Keeping in mind the fact that no values of stocks can make up more than 35%, and no values of stocks and be below 5%, by mathematical calculation, this leaves us with the optimum weighting of 35% for the first stock, 25% for the second stocks, and 5% each for the rest of the 8 stocks. In this case we can guarantee that 60% of our portfolio is driven by the two riskiest stocks, that correlates the same way, and the rest 40% of our portfolio is driven by 8 stocks that are less risky, but also correlates the same way. In this case, we created a portfolio that follows our condition for a risky portfolio, which is more concentrated, and have the least amount of variation stocks possible, but also not violating the rules for the assignment at the same time."
